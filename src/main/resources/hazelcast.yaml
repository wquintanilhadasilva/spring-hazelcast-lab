#  map:
#    default:
#      # Data type that will be used for storing recordMap.
#      # Possible values:
#      # BINARY (default): keys and values will be stored as binary data
#      # OBJECT : values will be stored in their object forms
#      # NATIVE : values will be stored in non-heap region of JVM
#      in-memory-format: BINARY
#      
#      # Metadata creation policy for this map. Hazelcast may process
#      # objects of supported types ahead of time to create additional
#      # metadata about them. This metadata then is used to make querying
#      # and indexing faster. Metadata creation may decrease put
#      # throughput. Valid values are:
#      # CREATE_ON_UPDATE (default): Objects of supported types are
#      # pre-processed when they are created and updated.
#      # OFF: No metadata is created.
#      metadata-policy: CREATE_ON_UPDATE
#        
#      # Whether map level statistical information (total
#      # hits, memory-cost etc.) should be gathered and stored.
#      statistics-enabled: true
#      
#      # Whether statistical information (hits, creation
#      # time, last access time etc.) should be gathered
#      # and stored. You have to enable this if you plan to
#      # implement a custom eviction policy, out-of-the-box
#      # eviction policies work regardless of this setting.
#      per-entry-stats-enabled: false
#      
#      cache-deserialized-values: ALWAYS
#      
#      # Number of backups. If 1 is set as the backup-count for example,
#      # then all entries of the map will be copied to another JVM for
#      # fail-safety. 0 means no backup.
#      backup-count: 2
#      
#      # Number of async backups. 0 means no backup.
#      async-backup-count: 2
#  
#      # Maximum number of seconds for each item to live.
#      # Any integer between 0 and Integer.MAX_VALUE. 0 means infinite. Default is 0.
#      time-to-live-seconds: 2
#  
#      # Maximum number of seconds for each item to stay idle (untouched).
#      # Any integer between 0 and Integer.MAX_VALUE. 0 means infinite. Default is 0.
#      max-idle-seconds: 2
